# MIT HST.936: Global health informatics to improve quality of care

The most daunting global health issues right now are the result of interconnected crises: the Covid pandemic, global warming, the economic fallouts of the pandemic, political extremism and polarization, and systemic racism. However, we also live in a time of powerful advances in information technology and artificial intelligence that can be applied to these formidable health problems. In this course, we highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to knowledge generation and validation.

This year, the focus will be on analysis of county-level excess mortality data that we have been collecting from the various state health departments. The data was aggregated from death certificates in each county from 2015 - 2020. We have been linking this data with mobility data, population census, outbreak dashboards, hospital and ICU census, Media Cloud news articles, etc. to better understand the drivers of excess mortality during the pandemic.
