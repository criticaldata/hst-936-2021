# Project Repository Instructions

Each project team is required to update and maintain a code repository throughout the semester. 
This will also be the avenue for submitting required deliverables, such as the proposal and the final report.
If you have any questions or concerns, please ask on the course Slack.

### Instructions

1. Go to the Github Classroom assignment link: https://classroom.github.com/g/hVoXOH5B

2. Select your student email on the list. If you are not on the course roster, email hst936faculty@mit.edu

3. Look to see if your team has already been created and join the existing team.

5. If you do not see your team and you are certain your team has not been created yet, create a team using the prefix "team-", appending your team letter at the end. E.g. "team-x".
Please DO NOT create a new team if your team already exists, as this will create a duplicate repository and downstream headaches.
